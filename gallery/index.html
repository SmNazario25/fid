<h1>&hearts;&emsp;<i>Black Goose Bistro Gallery</i>&emsp;&hearts;</h1>
<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="juicy burger"></a><br>People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="delicious fish"></a><br>Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Finger-Lickin' Gewd Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="delicious fish"></a><br>This is our prized and totally not copyrighted fried chicken from Kansas. Some might call it <b>Kansas Fried Chicken</b>! Here at the bistro, we strive to bring you the best quality dishes despite legal ramifications. If a government agent should arrive at your table, please be sure to notify one of our staff members and we will be sure to promptly shut down, disband, and expunge whatever information is left behind that will leave evidence that this place ever existed.</p>

<h2>Los Papitos Locos</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="Crazy Fries: nothing more, nothing less."></a><br>¡Ven hoy a probar nuestros <b>"Papitos Locos!"</b> ¡Prueba con cualquier tipo de salsa loca que tu corazón desee, como ketchup, mayonesa, mayu-kechu o mostaza! ¡Si vienes hoy, ganarás un par de maracas grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrratis!</p>
	
<h2>What Even is Tabouleh?</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="I literally have no idea what this is and will probably google it after this assignment."></a><br><i>Do you know what this <b>thing</b> is?</i> Neither do we! That's why we want you to come on down and try this delicious whatever-it-is. Seriously, though, we need people to start buying this stuff. There's too much of it in the kitchen and the staff has no idea where they came from.</p>
